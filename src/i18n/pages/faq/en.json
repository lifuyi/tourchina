        "description": "The guide is a downloadable PDF file that works on any device - your phone, tablet, laptop, or e-reader. It's designed to be read offline, so you can access it anytime during your trip without internet."
      },
      {
        "title": "Can I access it offline?",
        "description": "Yes! Once you download the PDF, you can access it completely offline. This is especially important in China where internet access can be restricted. We recommend downloading it to your device before your trip."

It saves you dozens of hours of research and stress during your trip."
      },
      {
        "title": "Is the content AI-generated?",
        "description": "Absolutely not. Every word is written by real travelers who spent weeks in China in September 2025, navigating the challenges firsthand. We used AI for nothing - just real experiences, real photos we took ourselves, and real advice that actually works. This is authentic content based on trial and error."
      },
      {
        "title": "Who created this guide?",
        "description": "This guide was created by independent travelers who navigated China in September 2025.

Every tip in this guide comes from our real experiences."
